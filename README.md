# Vegetable
The code helps in understanding the dataset, exploring vegetable prices, and drawing meaningful conclusions about seasonal variations and trends. 
It provides valuable information for consumers, retailers, and researchers interested in the vegetable market.

## Data Cleaning:
 
1. Collect - Acquire and load the data from the Data Source.

2. Filter - Select subset of the data based on certain conditions to focus on specific parts of the dataset.

3. Remove duplicate - eliminate redundant data to ensure each data point is unique and meaningful for analysis.

4. Replace Values - Substitute specific values in the data to correct errors or standardize data entries.

5. Rename - Change the names of columns to something more meaningful or appropriate for analysis.

6. Missing Values - Deal with gaps or null values in the data by filling it with specific values or removing the entries altogether.


### Data Exploration and Visualization:

1. Average prices for each vegetable are calculated and visualized using a bar plot.

2. Each vegetable's most expensive and cheapest seasons are determined and visualized using bar plots.

3. The average salad weight is calculated based on specific vegetable weights, and a new "Salad" column is created in the dataset.

4. The average salad cost is analyzed by the day of the week and visualized using a bar plot.

5. The average salad cost is analyzed by month and visualized using a bar plot and line plot.

6. The average salad price over time is visualized using a line plot.

## Conclusions:

1. The code provides valuable insights into the average prices of various vegetables and fruits.

2. The visualization of average prices helps identify vegetables and fruits that are consistently priced higher or lower.

3. Analyzing the most expensive and cheapest seasons for each vegetable allows for better understanding of seasonal variations in prices.

4. The analysis of salad cost by the day of the week provides insights into potential price variations based on weekdays.

5. The analysis of salad cost by the month helps identify any seasonal patterns or trends in salad prices.

6. The visualization of average salad price over time allows for tracking price fluctuations and identifying long-term trends.
